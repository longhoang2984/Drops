<h4>Drops is an app that helps people get out of bad day ruts. If you have ever had a bad day then this is the app for you. It keeps track of you good and bad days. On good days Drops asks you to give positive messages/Drops to people who are having a bad day, and on bad days you start receiving positive messages that will help shift your mindset so you can start smiling again.</h4>

Here is an old pdf to kind of get the idea. The new version of the app can be seen by downloading this and running it in xcode. I think the new version is much better!
